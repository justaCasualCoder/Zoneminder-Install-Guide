# About the program
I made this because I LOVED Zoneminder, although I had no idea how to get it set up.
After a few months, I learned how to install it (as well as Apache and MariaDB) on multiple Linux OSs. 
I wanted to make it easier for other people to try Zoneminder, and since I was learning BASH then, I decided to try to make this script. Since then it has just been a fun project for me...
